We&amp;rsquo;ll also show how to call the module from a Terragrunt config file, keeping inputs clean and environment-friendly.
🤔 Access Policy vs. RBAC Model Azure Key Vault supports two access models:
Model Description Recommended? Access Policy Classic model where you explicitly define what each principal can do ❌ Legacy RBAC Uses Azure’s Role-Based Access Control via Azure AD ✅ Yes!</description></item><item><title>Create Your Own: Custom Question Answering with Azure AI Services</title><link>https://ainframinds.com/ai/synth-minds-in-action/custom-qa-bot/</link><pubDate>Thu, 17 Apr 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://ainframinds.com/ai/synth-minds-in-action/custom-qa-bot/</guid><description>🧠 What is Custom Question Answering? Custom Question Answering (CQA) is a feature under Azure AI Language Service that allows you to build a knowledge-based Q&amp;amp;A system. Instead of writing code or training ML models, you simply provide documents or URLs — Azure does the rest.
Think of it like building your own version of ChatGPT — but trained on your company&amp;rsquo;s internal documents, policies, FAQs, or even PDFs.

Let’s walk through the steps to install it.
🧑‍💻 Step-by-Step: Installing Terragrunt ✅ Prerequisites Make sure Terraform is already installed on your system.
If not, check out: 🧱 Install Terraform &amp;amp; Azure CLI

If Terraform is your toolbox for provisioning infrastructure, then Terragrunt is the engineer who carries that toolbox from one environment to another, making sure all your tools are configured correctly and reused effectively.
Real-World Analogy 🏗️🔁 🧰 Terraform is like a set of high-quality tools: a hammer, a drill, a tape measure, and so on.</description></item><item><title>Download and Install Terraform and Azure CLI</title><link>https://ainframinds.com/iac/concepts/download-and-install/</link><pubDate>Fri, 11 Apr 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://ainframinds.com/iac/concepts/download-and-install/</guid><description>🛠️ Download and Install Terraform &amp;amp; Azure CLI Before diving into Infrastructure as Code, let’s set up the two most important tools you’ll need: Terraform and Azure CLI. These tools let you define, test, and manage your Azure resources directly from your machine.
1️⃣ Install Terraform Terraform is distributed as a single binary. Here&amp;rsquo;s how to install it on different platforms:

It enables users to define and provision infrastructure resources across cloud providers using a declarative configuration language called HCL (HashiCorp Configuration Language).
What is Terraform? Think of Terraform like a blueprint for your infrastructure.
