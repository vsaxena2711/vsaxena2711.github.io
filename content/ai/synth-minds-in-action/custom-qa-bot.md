## 🧠 What is Custom Question Answering?

Custom Question Answering (CQA) is a feature under **Azure AI Language Service** that allows you to build a knowledge-based Q&A system. Instead of writing code or training ML models, you simply provide documents or URLs — Azure does the rest.

Think of it like building your own version of ChatGPT — but trained on your company's internal documents, policies, FAQs, or even PDFs.

---

## 📦 What You’ll Build

A simple Question Answering model that:

- Ingests your documents (PDFs, Word, or URLs)
- Extracts Q&A pairs using Azure's built-in AI
- Can be queried through a web interface or REST API

---

## 🧰 Prerequisites

- An [Azure subscription](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/free/)
- Contributor/Owner access to create resources
- Some personal documents to test with (PDFs, FAQs, etc.)

---

## 🚀 Step-by-Step Setup

### 🔹 Step 1: Create an Azure AI Language Resource

1. Go to [Azure Portal](https://portal.azure.com)
2. Search for **Language** and choose **Azure AI Language**
3. Click **Create**
4. Fill in the basics:
   - Subscription & Resource Group
   - Region: e.g., East US
   - Name: `language-cqa-demo`
   - Pricing Tier: Choose F0 (Free) or S tier
5. Click **Review + Create** → then **Create**

---

### 🔹 Step 2: Create a Custom Question Answering Project

1. Go to the [Language Studio](https://language.azure.com/)
2. Sign in with the same Azure account
3. Click **Custom Question Answering** under the "Build" section
4. Choose your newly created resource
5. Click **+ New Project**
   - Project Name: `faq-ai-bot`
   - Language: English
   - Description: “My first custom AI bot”
   - Click **Create**

---

### 🔹 Step 3: Add Knowledge Sources

You can add sources by:

#### 📁 Uploading files:
- PDFs, DOCX, TXT files
- Click **+ Add Source** → **Files**
- Upload your own company FAQ or document

#### 🌐 Adding URLs:
- Add a webpage (like your company policy or GitHub Wiki)
- Language Studio will auto-scrape Q&A pairs

#### ✍️ Manual Q&A:
- Add custom question-answer pairs directly
- Helpful for adding targeted responses

---

### 🔹 Step 4: Train the Project

1. Once your sources are added, click **Train**
2. Wait a few seconds — training is fast!
3. You’ll get a notification when training completes

---

### 🔹 Step 5: Test Your Model

1. Go to the **Test** tab
2. Ask questions based on your content:
   - “What is our refund policy?”
   - “How do I reset my password?”
3. See how your model responds!
4. Tweak answers as needed by editing the extracted Q&A pairs

---

### 🔹 Step 6: Deploy the Project

1. Click the **Deploy** tab
2. Click **Deploy project**
3. This will create a public endpoint and assign a deployment name (e.g., `faq-bot-prod`)

---

## 🔑 Using the API

Once deployed, you can call your Q&A bot via REST API:

```bash
POST https://<your-resource-name>.cognitiveservices.azure.com/language/:query-knowledgebases?projectName=faq-ai-bot&deploymentName=faq-bot-prod&api-version=2021-10-01
```
Add headers:
```bash
    Ocp-Apim-Subscription-Key: <your-key>
    Content-Type: application/json
```
And body:
```bash
    {
        "question": "How do I reset my password?"
    }
```
