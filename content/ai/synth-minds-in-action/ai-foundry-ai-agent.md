> *Like Remy the rat in **Ratatouille** ‚Äî **"Anyone can Cook"**.*  
> *With Azure AI Foundry, anyone can build AI. Just drag, drop, and let the bot cook.* üë®‚Äçüç≥ü§ñ

Welcome to the world of **Azure AI Foundry**, where **Prompt Flow** makes AI development feel less like programming and more like storytelling. Whether you're an AI newbie or a seasoned dev, this platform strips away the noise and lets you focus on building **agentic solutions** with clarity and speed.

In this post, I‚Äôll walk you through how I used Azure AI Foundry to create a working AI bot using **Prompt Flow**, including:

- The magic behind the drag-and-drop experience üé®  
- Connecting tools, prompts, and data without writing heavy code üîå  
- Deploying it all with ML Endpoints ‚Äî no dev-ops chaos üîß  
- Lessons learned and what‚Äôs next on this AI journey üîÑ

## üß© Use Case: What This Bot Actually Does

Before we dive into building, let‚Äôs talk about the **"why"**. This POC simulates a unified chatbot assistant designed to support multiple enterprise workflows through natural language ‚Äî turning scattered systems into one seamless AI-driven interface.

### üß† Business Use Cases

The bot is built to understand and act on the following types of queries:

- **GetJiraTicket**: Retrieve ticket details based on a Jira-style ID (e.g., `ABC-123`).
- **GetCommitsForTicket**: Fetch Git commits associated with a specific ticket ID.
- **SearchConfluenceDocs**: Look through internal documentation (like Confluence) using natural-language search.
- **SearchSharePointDocs**: Find SharePoint-stored SOPs or internal guides based on keywords.

### üß™ Simulated Environment Setup

Since real enterprise tools weren‚Äôt available for this demo, we simulated them using accessible public resources:

| Real Tool             | Simulated Using                          |
|-------------------    |-------------------------------------------|
| Jira Tickets          | &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;GitHub Issues                            |
| GitLab Commits        | &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;GitHub Commits API                       |
| Confluence Docs       | &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;GitHub Markdown Files (`/docs` folder)   |
| SharePoint Docs       | &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Azure Blob Storage with public `.txt` files |

This setup lets us test core logic and integration patterns without exposing real production data ‚Äî perfect for a secure and cost-effective POC.

Next, let‚Äôs explore how you can build this out yourself using Azure AI Foundry.
